What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  Data is a corner stone of many computer science focused specialties. Companies, researchers, innovators alike have data, need data, want more data. With the ever increasing amount of data it becomes more and more necessary to have good tools to organize and present the data in a user friendly organized way. In this course we examined different ways to handle data sets and how efficient the algorithms were to get the job done. 
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  The data sets we used were pretty small in comparison to what would be seen by a data analysist in the real world. The files we used to apply the algorithms took less than a second to organize and present the data. To conceptualize the importance of big O notation and it’s application in the real world, I imagined the files we used being a few hundred pages with tens of thousands of entries. If that became the case, an efficiency difference of half a second per page becomes much more important.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   I tried initially to use a mac book pro and VS code to write my C++ program, however Microsoft obviously doesn’t spend a lot of effort helping apple develop on their software. I discovered issues at the compiler level on my mac, trying various dependencies and extensions for VS Code. I believe I got close to making it work but I fell behind in my course work not only in this class but my other as well so I reverted to my old windows computer to catch up and complete assignments. 

  I also had an issue where I broke my final project right before I turned it in. I had it running with the minimum viable program performing the requirements of the assignment (although I would have liked to add a few tweaks to make it better) When I got notification that my grade was an F, I downloaded what I had submitted but couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t working. Parts of the code that should have been fine had strange bug reports and testing didn’t work. When I used the Visual Studio “roll back to a previous version” tool, the program ran but had 90 errors and wasn’t the finished product I had thought I was submitting. The solution was not even in the code I was writing but the way the files were build, somehow I had the parser and binary search tree class in the zipped folder I uploaded but they were not present in the solution when you opened the .sln file. 



How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   I would say I have a much better understanding of Big O notation and it’s importance. Writing code that is not only concise but efficient will take me far I’m sure. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   I came across a tool while in this course that I had never heard of. The “Change log”. I had previously been using an open MS word doc to save the previous version of my program in case some change I made broke the program and I couldn’t get back to the working version. I discovered Visual Studios very simple command “#region” and using that and a window that wasn’t built into the program I was able to compress thousands of lines of various versions of code into a single page where I could open the compressed sections to compare or just replace the working version.
